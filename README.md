## Introduction

The **Azure CAF rover** is a Docker container in charge of the deployment of the landing zones in your Azure environment. It is acting as a **sandbox toolchain** development environment to avoid impacting the local machine but more importantly to make sure that all contributors in the GitOps teams are using a **consistent set of tools** and version.

The Azure CAF rover is the same container regarless you are using Windows, Linux or macOS. On the local GitOps machine you need to install Visual Studio Code. The Azure CAF rover is executed locally in a container.
